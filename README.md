# Hostel Management System

This project is a web application designed to manage and streamline hostel-related operations, built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js**, **npm**, **XAMPP**, and **MySQL** installed on your machine.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Frontend Setup**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Install Main Dependencies**

   In the root **hostel management** directory, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Running the Application**

   To start the application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start both the frontend and backend servers if configured correctly.

### Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive layouts.
- **Flask**: Lightweight backend framework for handling server logic.
- **XAMPP**: Local development environment to manage Apache and MySQL.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing hostel data.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure XAMPP is running, with **Apache** and **MySQL** servers started, to enable database connectivity.
- Adjust configurations as needed in the `.env` file for database connection details, such as MySQL username and password.
